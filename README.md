## Summary

The game features a farmer trying to make a profit on their farm. The only problem is, the farm keeps getting overrun by weeds. Everyday weeds appear and pre existing weeds spread. The longer the farmer lets them sit, the worse the weeds get.
Any crops with weeds beside them, have a chance at wilting the next day.
If the farmer fails to make their weekly quota, it's game over for the farm. But if they succeed, theyâ€™ll be able to purchase upgrades for the farm to make their life easier. But the longer they work the farm, the worse the weeds get.
